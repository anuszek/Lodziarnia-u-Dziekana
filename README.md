*Where academic excellence meets frozen deliciousness!*

## 📚 About This Project

Welcome to the most **scholarly** ice cream experience on mobile! This React Native app helps you locate the finest ice cream establishments around campus, because even the Dean needs a sweet break from grading papers.

### 🎓 Features That Make the Grade

- 📍 **Interactive Map**: Find ice cream shops faster than you can say "semester break"
- 🍨 **Stall Information**: Detailed info about each vendor (opening hours, specialties, ratings)
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on both iOS and Android - unlike your professor's old PowerPoint slides
- 🎯 **Custom Markers**: Beautiful map pins that won't give you rendering nightmares on physical devices

### 🧑‍🎓 Tech Stack (Dean-Approved)

- **React Native** - Because native development is harder than organic chemistry
- **Expo** - Making deployment easier than getting an extension on your thesis
- **TypeScript** - Adding types like adding citations - mandatory and helpful
- **React Native Maps** - For navigation smoother than your favorite vanilla shake
